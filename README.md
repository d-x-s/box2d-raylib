# box2d-raylib
This project is a fork of Erin Catto's box2d/raylib demonstration.
I have converted the project to C++ and added a demo feature that allows users to spawn more boxes with left click.

To build and run this project:
1) Clone the repo
2) In the root folder do `mkdir build`
3) `cd build`
4) `cmake ..`
5) Open `game.sln` in Visual Studio
6) Build
7) Launch the generated `game.exe` in `build/Debug`
